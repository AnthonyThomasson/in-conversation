# In Conversation

"In Conversation" is a social experiment where people of different backgrounds and beliefs are paired up to have a conversation. The goal is to see if people can have a conversation with someone they disagree with and still remain civil. Conversations in which both parties have found value are highlighted and showcased on each persons profile.
